   105 INTELS · ONE API · PERMISSIONLESS
```

**The permissionless intelligence layer for AI agents.**

Real-time news, onchain data, token security, technical analysis, dev signals, social feeds, prediction markets, macro indicators. 105 prebuilt intel modules. One API. No KYC, no signup approvals, no account gatekeepers.

The free tier is fully keyless. Just call. Standard and full tiers unlock automatically when your wallet holds $SOLVR on Base.

## Permissionless by design

| Tier | Permissionless | Keyless | How to access |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | ✅ | ✅ | Just call. No wallet, no key, no signup. |
| **Standard** | ✅ | ❌ | Hold 20M $SOLVR onchain. Code is the only gatekeeper. |
| **Full** | ✅ | ❌ | Hold 1B $SOLVR onchain. Code is the only gatekeeper. |

Every tier is permissionless. No human approves you, no KYC, no whitelist. The free tier is also keyless. Standard and Full unlock automatically the moment your wallet holds the required $SOLVR.

## Quick Start

Free tier endpoints are **keyless**. No registration, no wallet, no approval. Just call.

### 1. Use free endpoints immediately (no key)

```python
import requests

BASE = "https://api.solvrbot.com"

# News — real-time headlines from BBC, Guardian, Al Jazeera, NPR
news = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/v1/news", params={"topic": "crypto regulation"}).json()

# GitHub trending
repos = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/v1/github/trending", params={"language": "python"}).json()

# Reddit hot posts
posts = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/v1/reddit", params={"subreddit": "wallstreetbets"}).json()

# Farcaster trending casts
casts = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/v1/farcaster").json()

# Polymarket prediction markets
markets = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/v1/polymarket", params={"topic": "crypto"}).json()

# DEX token search
tokens = requests.get(f"{BASE}/api/v1/dex/search", params={"q": "SOLVR"}).json()
```

### 2. Unlock standard + full tier (stake $SOLVR)

Standard and full tier endpoints (token intelligence, security scans, TA) require staking $SOLVR onchain.

```python
import time, requests
from eth_account import Account
from eth_account.messages import encode_defunct

# One-time registration — links your wallet for tier verification
wallet = "0xYOUR_WALLET"
private_key = "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
timestamp = int(time.time())
message = f"Register Solvr agent\nWallet: {wallet}\nTimestamp: {timestamp}"
sig = Account.sign_message(encode_defunct(text=message), private_key=private_key)
resp = requests.post(f"{BASE}/api/v1/agent/register", json={
    "wallet": wallet, "sig": sig.signature.hex(), "timestamp": timestamp,
})
api_key = resp.json()["api_key"]  # store securely

# Then stake at solvrbot.com/staking — tier activates immediately onchain
```

### 3. Use an intel file directly

Each `intels/*.md` file is a self-contained intel definition. Drop it into any agent runner that supports structured intel files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solvrbase/solvr
cp intels/token-report.md your-agent/intels/
```

---

## Examples by tier

### Free tier: keyless one-liners

No auth, no signup. Works from `curl`, any agent, any browser. IP rate-limited.

```bash
# Real-time news on any topic (GDELT-backed, no key needed)
curl "https://api.solvrbot.com/api/v1/news?topic=AI+regulation&limit=3"

# Macro / world data (180+ countries, World Bank + FRED)
curl "https://api.solvrbot.com/api/v1/worlddata?query=fed+rate"

# DEX trending tokens on Base
curl "https://api.solvrbot.com/api/v1/dex/trending"

# Polymarket prediction markets
curl "https://api.solvrbot.com/api/v1/polymarket?topic=election"
```

### Standard tier: pre-trade defense pattern

Before any financial action, run the security guard. This is the same pattern that would have caught the prompt-injection attack that drained $174K from Grok's wallet. Requires 20M $SOLVR held in your registered wallet.

```python
import requests

HEADERS = {"Authorization": "Bearer solvr_your_key_here"}
BASE = "https://api.solvrbot.com"

def safe_to_send(to_address: str, ca: str) -> bool:
    # 1. Scan the destination wallet + token
    scan = requests.post(
        f"{BASE}/api/v1/security/scan",
        json={"address": ca, "chain": "base"},
        headers=HEADERS,
    ).json()
    if scan["risk_score"] > 35 or scan["verdict"] != "LOW RISK":
        return False

    # 2. Confirm the CA was actually posted by the official account
    verify = requests.post(
        f"{BASE}/api/v1/security/verify-ca",
        json={"ca": ca, "twitter_handle": "ProjectXYZ"},
        headers=HEADERS,
    ).json()
    return verify["verdict"] in ("VERIFIED", "LIKELY_LEGIT")

# Agent calls this BEFORE any tx — no security check, no signature.
```

### Full tier: autonomous fleet and self-improvement

Hold 1B $SOLVR to unlock the full intel set: streaming feeds, agent spawning, fleet orchestration, and the self-healing loop.

```python
# Spawn a specialized monitoring agent with a curated intel set
requests.post(
    f"{BASE}/api/v1/fleet/spawn",
    json={
        "name": "narrative-scout",
        "intels": ["narrative-tracker", "monitor-runners", "token-pick"],
        "schedule": "*/15 * * * *",
        "notify": "telegram",
    },
    headers=HEADERS,
)

# The spawned agent runs unattended, self-heals on broken intels,
# and reports back via your chosen channel.
```

## How Solvr compares to centralized intelligence

The closest thing to Solvr in the legacy world is a Bloomberg Terminal seat: a single subscription that gives a professional access to news, market data, alerts, analytics, and signals. Solvr does that for AI agents, without the gatekeeping.

|  | **Solvr** | OpenAI Platform | Anthropic API | Perplexity API | Bloomberg Terminal | CoinGecko Pro |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Type** | Intelligence API for agents | LLM inference | LLM inference | AI search / news | Enterprise intel terminal | Crypto market data |
| **Access** | Permissionless. Free tier keyless. | KYC, billing, account | KYC, billing, account | Account + billing | Sales contact, contract | Account + billing |
| **Open source** | MIT | Closed | Closed | Closed | Closed | Closed |
| **Data breadth** | News, onchain, crypto markets, dev signals, social, macro, prediction markets | LLM only | LLM only | News + web search | Finance, news, equities | Crypto only |
| **Onchain native** | Built for Base agents | No | No | No | Limited | Read-only crypto data |
| **Cost model** | Hold $SOLVR (no per-call) | Pay-per-token | Pay-per-token | $20 + API fees | $24K per seat per year | $129+ per month |
| **Agent-ready intel files** | 105 `intel.md` files | None | None | None | None | None |
| **Identity** | Wallet signature | Email + KYC | Email + KYC | Email | Verified enterprise | Email |

The unique slot: Solvr is the only multi-source intelligence layer where access is gated by code, not by a sales team or a payments wall. Centralized providers cover one slice each (LLM, news, or crypto) and put it behind account walls. Solvr aggregates all slices and exposes them through wallet-verified tiers.

## Self-healing loop

The 14 meta-agent intels form a closed loop that keeps a Solvr-powered agent running unattended. Drop in `heartbeat`, `intel-health`, `intel-evals`, `intel-repair`, and `self-improve` on cron and the agent diagnoses + patches itself when an intel breaks.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[heartbeat<br/>3× daily] --> B[intel-health<br/>endpoint + freshness]
    B --> C[intel-evals<br/>quality score 1-5]
    C --> D{score &lt; 3?}
    D -->|yes| E[intel-repair<br/>diagnose + fix]
    D -->|no| F[self-improve<br/>tune prompts + config]
    E --> A
    F --> A
```

| Step | Intel | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Detect | [`heartbeat`](./intels/heartbeat.md) | Periodic ping — confirms agent is alive and all required endpoints respond |
| 2. Audit | [`intel-health`](./intels/intel-health.md) | Checks every installed intel for broken endpoints, stale configs, missing fields |
| 3. Score | [`intel-evals`](./intels/intel-evals.md) | Runs assertion-based output quality tests, scores each intel 1–5 |
| 4. Repair | [`intel-repair`](./intels/intel-repair.md) | Diagnoses root cause (404 / 403 / 429 / 5xx) and patches the intel |
| 5. Improve | [`self-improve`](./intels/self-improve.md) | Evolves prompts + configs based on rolling performance data |
| Tracking | [`cost-report`](./intels/cost-report.md) · [`operator-scorecard`](./intels/operator-scorecard.md) | Weekly cost + quality dashboard |

Each step is a separate intel file, not a bundled framework. Mix and match the ones you need.

---

## Integrations

Solvr is plain HTTP under the hood, so anything that can `fetch` can call it. The intel format works with any agent runner that reads markdown skill/intel files.

| Stack | How it integrates | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw HTTP** | Any language, any client | `curl https://api.solvrbot.com/api/v1/news` |
| **Python SDK** | `solvr_intel.py` — typed client for every endpoint | `intel.news("topic")`, `intel.security_scan("0x...")` |
| **TypeScript / JS** | `fetch` + Bearer header | `fetch(url, { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer ..." } })` |
| **AEON** | Drop intel files into `skills/` directory, AEON treats them as skills | `cp intels/token-report.md aeon/skills/` |
| **Bankr** | `intel.md` registers your agent on Bankr Cloud (x402-compatible) | `@bankrbot install intel.md` |
| **OpenClaw** | `intel.md` is OpenClaw-compatible — drop into the agent's intel directory | OpenClaw reads frontmatter + body directly |
| **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** | Copy the intel.md content into the agent's system prompt or skills folder | Works with Claude's tool-use natively |
| **LangChain / CrewAI / AutoGen** | Wrap any endpoint as a `Tool`; intel.md describes the tool signature | One-line tool definition per intel |
| **MCP server** | _Planned_ — every intel exposed as an MCP tool | Coming Q2 |
| **A2A protocol** | _Planned_ — Google A2A gateway | Coming Q2 |

### Bankr Cloud (x402)

Solvr is registered as an x402-compatible agent on Bankr Cloud. Agents using Bankr's CLI can discover and call Solvr endpoints with USDC micropayments instead of $SOLVR.
